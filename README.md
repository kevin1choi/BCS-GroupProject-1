# Animated Text

Animated Text is the creation of digital media artist Cat Frazier. Cat needs to consolidate her separate tumblr blog and e-commerce site.

## Features

-A customizable website blueprint
-E-commerce platform with store, shopping cart, and checkout functionality
-Tumblr feed 
-Contact forms


## APIs

We worked with Shopify, Tumblr, Instagram, and Foundation APIs to implement the project. 

## Deployment

For the client's security (and due to Tumblr and Shopify restrictions) the API keys were removed. You will receive a separate .txt file with the client's API key (if you're lucky).
 
## Roadmap and Project Status
While we delivered the blueprint - or basic template - requested by the client, this was part of a longterm, scaleable project. 

In the short-term, we'll be able to upgrade the blog soon to give the client access to tumblr's posting and engagement functionalities (liking, Q&A, and reposting). Cat will provide further assets and design suggestions. 

The longterm goal is to create interactive animated "style novels." Users will have an immersive digital environment that goes far beyond the standard internet shopping experience.
